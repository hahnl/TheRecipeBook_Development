1 white onion, diced
1 red pepper, diced
1 green pepper, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
Blackening seasoning to taste (not much is enough, usually)
Black pepper to taste
1 package of four pepper andouille sausage (precooked), sliced
1 can of Southern style red beans and rice

Fry onions, peppers, celery in a pan on the stove on medium high heat. Use olive oil.
Sprinkle with blackening seasoning and black pepper.
This doesn't take long. Once the onions have begun to caramelize, add the sliced sausage.
Sprinkle on some more seasoning. Don't overpower the dish or it'll be too spicy.

Once the sausage is browned nicely and the flavors have begun to meld together, add the red beans and rice.
Then add a cup and a half of hot water, mix well. Taste. If it's not too spicy and not too flavorful, go ahead and sprinkle on some more blackening seasonsing and black pepper.
Let this simmer for about five minutes.
Serve with cornbread. Enjoy!
