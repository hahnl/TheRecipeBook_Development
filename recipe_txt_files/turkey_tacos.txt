Larissa's Turkey Tacos:

1 pound ground turkey
1 organic lemon
1 organic red pepper
1 organic red onion
2 cloves of fresh garlic
1 handful of diced jalapenos
1 packet of taco seasoning
1/2 cup of fresh garden salsa

Dice your red pepper and red onion and throw into a cooking pan that has been heated on Medium heat for about one minute with a tablespoon of organic coconut oil.

Once you've caramelized your onion and the red pepper is nice and roasted, dice the garlic and throw it in. Now it's time to add one pound of ground turkey to the pan, breaking it up into nice penny-sized chunks as you go.

After browning your meat without overcooking it, squeeze the juice from one organic lemon into the pan and fold in the flavors. Then add one packet of Taco seasoning.

Once the taco seasoning has been mixed in well with the meat, add a half cup of fresh garden salsa to the pan and just mix that right in with everything. Also now would be a good time to add those diced jalapenos.

Let this summer for about five minutes, lowering the heat. Don't overcook or the turkey will toughen up on you.

Serve on whole wheat soft tortillas that have been warmed in the oven for just a few seconds, approximately 10 seconds, on 325 degrees.

Add sour cream, chopped Romaine hearts, chopped red onion, and a spoonful of fresh garden salsa for a superior taco. Enjoy! :)
